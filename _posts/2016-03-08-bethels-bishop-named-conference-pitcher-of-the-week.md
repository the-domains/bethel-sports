Trevor Bishop of Bethel (Tenn.) has been selected as the SSAC Baseball Pitcher of the Week, while Tyler Odom of William Carey (Miss.) has been named the SSAC Baseball Player of the Week, the conference office announced Monday. The duo was chosen for their performances during the week of Feb. 29-March 6\. 

Bishop, a freshman right-handed pitcher for Bethel, threw a complete-game six-hitter as the Wildcats notched a 4-0 win over Loyola (La.) on the opening day of SSAC play.

In the second game of the doubleheader on March 4, Bishop recorded seven strikeouts, while scattering six hits. The Savannah, Tenn., native maintained a 0.00 ERA in the nine-inning effort en route to his second victory of the year.

Bishop paces the SSAC with just two walks and .65 walks allowed per game, while ranking among the league leaders in runs allowed (2nd, 6), earned runs allowed (2nd, 6), earned run average (5th, 1.95), hits allowed per game (10th, 7.81), innings pitched per game (11th, 5.53), hits allowed (12th, 24), innings pitched (12th, 27.2), opponents batting average (15th, .250), strikeouts (17th, 20) and strikeouts per game (17th, 6.51).  

The freshman ranks 20th in the NAIA in walks allowed per game and 33rd in walks allowed.

Odom, a junior infielder for receiving votes William Carey, hit .478 (11-of-23) on the week as the Crusaders went 6-0---including a three-game sweep of Martin Methodist (Tenn.) to open conference play.

The Hattiesburg, Miss., native accumulated 11 hits---including two doubles, three triples and two home runs---over the six-game week. He also tallied 14 RBI, eight runs scored and a walk. The junior's biggest game came in a 13-2 rout of Calumet (Ind.) on Feb. 29, when he went 3-for-4 with a triple, two runs scored and three RBI.

After slugging 1.087 on the week, Odom ranks among the SSAC elite in hits (2nd, 29), triples (3rd, 3), total bases (3rd, 46), hits per game (4th, 1.53), triples per game (4th, .16), total bases per game (4th, 2.42), batting average (5th, .439), slugging percentage (5th, .697), runs batted in per game (5th, 1.10), runs batted in (6th, 21), doubles per game (13th, .26), doubles (14th, 5) and on-base percentage (17th, .472).

Nationally, Odom ranks 13th in triples, 37th in hits, 40th in total bases and 40th in triples per game.

William Carey becomes the fifth program to have a student-athlete noted as either the SSAC Pitcher of the Week or Player of the Week during the 2016 campaign, joining Auburn Montgomery (Ala.), Bethel, Faulkner (Ala.) and Martin Methodist.
